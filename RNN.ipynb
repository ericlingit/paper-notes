    "Google's 2014 [sequence to sequence paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf) says that \"... we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM’s performance markedly, ...\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> Surprisingly, the LSTM did not suffer on very long sentences, despite the recent experience of otherresearchers with related architectures [26]. We were able to do well on long sentences because wereversed the order of words in the source sentence but not thetarget sentences in the training and testset. By doing so, we introduced many short term dependenciesthat made the optimization problemmuch simpler (see sec. 2 and 3.3). As a result, SGD could learnLSTMs that had no trouble withlong sentences. The simple trick of reversing the words in the source sentence is one of the keytechnical contributions of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ... we found it extremely valuable to reverse the order of the words of the input sentence. So for example, instead of mapping the sentence `a, b, c` to the sentence `α, β, γ`, the LSTM is asked to map `c, b, a` to `α, β, γ`, where `α, β, γ` is the translation of `a, b, c`. This way, `a` is in close proximity to `α`, `b` is fairly close to `β`, and so on, a fact that makes it easy for SGD to 'establish communication' between the input and the output. We found this simple data transformation to greatly boost the performance of the LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While we do not have a complete explanation to this phenomenon, we believe that it is caused by the introduction of many short term dependencies to the dataset. Normally, when we concatenate a source sentence with a target sentence, each word in the source sentence is far from its corresponding word in the target sentence. As a result, the problem has a large \"minimal time lag\" [17]. By reversing the words in the source sentence, the average distance between corresponding words inthe source and target language is unchanged. However, the first few words in the source language are now very close to the first few words in the target language, so the problem’s minimal time lag is greatly reduced. Thus, backpropagation has an easier time \"establishing communication\" between the source sentence and the target sentence, which in turn results in substantially improved overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Initially, we believed that reversing the input sentences would only lead to more confident predictions in the early parts of the target sentence and to less confident predictions in the later parts. However, LSTMs trained on reversed source sentences did much better on long sentences than LSTMs trained on the raw source sentences ..., which suggests that reversing the input sentences results in LSTMs with better memory utilization.\n",

    "[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078) introduced the encoder-decoder architecture that uses 2 modified RNNs (with 2 gates to control how much of the hidden state to forget or modify). The encoder turns a variable-length sequence (sentence of words) into a fixed length vector representation. The decoder uses that vector to produce either a score or sequences that are fed in to a statistical machine translation model to help improve its performance.\n",

    "[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) from Google used 2 LSTMs to create an encoder-decoder model for neural machine translation. The encoder turns a variable-length sequence (sentence of words) into a fixed length vector. That vector is fed into the decoder and outputs a variable-length sequence (the translation). They discovered that reversing the input sentence improves the translation score markedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) added attention to the encoder-decoder architecture. It also used a bi-directional RNN encoder. The authors argued that turning a sentence into a single vector creates a bottleneck, and can limit the performance (how well it translates a sentence) of the model. By adding a soft attention vector that learns which parts of the input sentences that matter, it can improve the performance of the model. This attention vector will direct the decoder to look for specific words in the input when generating an output word.\n",
    "It does not encode the input sentence into a single fixed-length vector. Instead, it encodes the input sentence into a sequence of vectors, and chooses a subset of these vectors adaptively while emitting the translation. This frees a neural translation model from having to squash all the information of a source sentence, regardless of its length, into a fixed-length vector. This allows a model to cope better with long sentences.\n",
